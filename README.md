[Sangria](http://sangria-graphql.org/) is a scala [GraphQL](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/) library.

SBT Configuration:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.sangria-graphql" %% "sangria" % "1.4.2"
``` 

You can find an example application that uses akka-http with sangria here:

https://github.com/sangria-graphql/sangria-akka-http-example

More info and the documentation can be found in the project home page:

[http://sangria-graphql.org](http://sangria-graphql.org)

I would also recommend you to check out [http://try.sangria-graphql.org](http://try.sangria-graphql.org).
It is an example of GraphQL server written with Play framework and Sangria. It also serves as a playground,
where you can interactively execute GraphQL queries and play with some examples.

If you want to use sangria with [react-relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay) framework, then you also may be interested in [sangria-relay](https://github.com/sangria-graphql/sangria-relay).

Sangria is a spec compliant GraphQL implementation, so it works out of the box with [Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client), [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/), [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) and other GraphQL tools and libraries.


## Hello World Example

In this example we will use [circe](https://github.com/circe/circe) JSON marshalling, so we also need to include following dependency:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.sangria-graphql" %% "sangria-circe" % "1.2.1"
```

The most simple Hello World application might look like this:

```scala
import sangria.schema._
import sangria.execution._
import sangria.macros._
import sangria.marshalling.circe._
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

val QueryType = ObjectType("Query", fields[Unit, Unit](
  Field("hello", StringType, resolve = _ ⇒ "Hello world!")
))

val schema = Schema(QueryType)

val query = graphql"{ hello }"

val result = Executor.execute(schema, query)

result.foreach(res ⇒ println(res.spaces2))
```

this example will print following result JSON:

```json
{
  "data" : {
    "hello" : "Hello world!"
  }
}
```
